# Digits
Application just for fun. You can draw any digit and Neural network will try to recognize it

## How to run
Just run file **main.py**

## Different Neural Networks
In this project we have several models. Unfortunately, there is no API for quick model change, but there will be soon. 
In this repo we have:
- Fully connected created in pure numpy 
- Convolution created in Keras
